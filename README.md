# Is Max at home?
Parents worry when children are not at home. Have they eaten anything yet? When will they be back? Our cat was home alone for a long time at times and when we returned we didn't know if he had stopped by in between. For this reason, I wanted to document his entrances and exits through the cat flap. Ready-made solutions are too big for our narrow window, so I built a solution myself. A standard cat flap with acceleration sensor (ADXL 345) and Raspberry-Pi, which sends the movement data to a Mastodon account.

# Mastodon Account
Max has, like every cool cat, it's own masotodon account. I use it to push the meausurements of this script trough it, so I don't need to build and host a website for this. You can see the results here:
